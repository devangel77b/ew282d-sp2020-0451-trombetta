\section{Introduction}
% Trombetta: Most of what I have is not running shin splints stuff; hopeful you found some there. I do have some general human running stuff in the list. You might ask 1/C Anmol Walha about running biomechanics, and 1/C Lily Bautista about walking and ankles? I have their 485 projects but not the references they found... 

To study the effectiveness and injury risk of heel strike versus forefoot strike running.

Explain heel strike versus forefoot strike

Work from an inverted triangle (broader topics to more specific). Explain what you are interested, review some relevant literature, and then set up what your specific research question is. Cite literature using the author-year format, as in \citep{buck2020go}. If you need pictures to explain the relevant biomechanics, feel free to include. This section should also say a little why your research matters. 

The last part of this section should be the specific hypotheses you seek to test.
