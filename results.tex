%Explain factually what you found... leave interpretation of what it means for the final discussion section. Here you would include plots of what you found or comparison tables.

\subsection{Improvised force plate kymograph}
Heel versus toe-strike two trials. Toe-strike only shows lateral movement of rig, primarily with left foot.
